Welcome to MIVEHIND.  This is the personal website of me, Robbie Harwood
(frozencemetery/rharwood).  It currently hosts my blog (out.log), this page,
and not much else.

Professionally, I am a computer scientist working on open source systems
software, the majority of which is tracked on
[github/frozencemetery](https://github.com/frozencemetery/).  If you're
interested in me in a professional capacity, you probably are after my
[resume](http://www.club.cc.cmu.edu/~rharwood/resume.pdf).

Unprofessionally, I listen to (and sometimes play) loud music.  I also have
been known to write, hug animals, cook plants, and on at least one occasion,
think for myself.

I will admit to the following contact methods:
