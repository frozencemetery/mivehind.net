Welcome to MIVEHIND.  This is the personal website of me, Robbie Harwood
(rharwood/frozencemetery).  It currently hosts my sporadic blog (out.log),
this page, and not much else.

If you're interested in me in a professional capacity, you probably are after
my [resume](https://rharwood.fedorapeople.org/resume.pdf).

If you want to contact me, I can be reached via email (rharwood AT pm DOT me).
For reference, I have previously also used as emails (rharwood AT redhat DOT
com) and (rharwood AT club DOT cc DOT cmu DOT edu), and my github handle is
[frozencemetery](https://github.com/frozencemetery/).
