Greetings!  My name is Robbie Harwood; this is my website.  Should you desire
to do so, you can find me through the methods listed in *whois* above.

If you're interested in me in a professional capacity, you probably are after
my [resume](http://www.club.cc.cmu.edu/~rharwood/resume.pdf).  Source for my
resume is available on request.

I am a computer scientist (and almost have the corresponding degree).  My
main interest is defensive security, especially in the application of type
theory and functional programming to program security.  I therefore think that
[Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/), [ATS](http://www.ats-lang.org/), and
[Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) are interesting research directions.
However, it is difficult to convince the developers of existing projects to
switch to another language after they have put time and effort into
development, especially when they do not know this language, and so most of my
time is spent writing code in other languages.  I am also a member of the
[PPP](http://www.pwning.net/) security research group.

When not engaged in the above, I also do some amateur systems administration.
My systems are typically [Debian](http://www.debian.org/),
[Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/), and/or
[RHEL-like](https://www.redhat.com/).  I mostly work with the
[CMUCC](https://www.club.cc.cmu.edu/services).

In the time I spend away from the computer keyboard, I also play guitar,
though of late this activity has suffered at the expense of the first two.
