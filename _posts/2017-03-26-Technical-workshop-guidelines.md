Semi-recently, I attended a workshop-style conference.  While I think I really
like the organization and their work, there were some issues in organizing
around "techies".  So from that, I'd like to present some suggestions as to
how to run one of these events:

1. **Make sure your wireless works.**  If your tooling lives on GitHub, and
   your venue's wireless blocks GitHub, you're going to have a bad time.
   (This is not a hypothetical example.)

1. **Be sure you have things to be done.**  This requires effort on your part:
   not only checking that the work exists, but that it is of reasonable
   scope.

1. **Match work to participants.**  In particular, do *not* give programming
   jobs to people who have never programmed before.  There is a tendency to be
   welcoming; keep in mind that people who are over their head are unlikely to
   return.

1. **Don't sweat inefficiency.**  Someone who knows the project or codebase
   already will be able to accomplish the tasks you have prepared faster (and
   possible better) than your attendees.  If the primary purpose of the event is
   either (or both!) of onboarding or face-to-face collaboration, then there's
   no reason to worry.
   
1. **Have mentors.**  Your participants will want to excel regardless of the
   previous item; it's natural.  And they'll feel better if they are enabled
   to do so; having a better time makes people more likely to stick around.

1. **Give time for schmoozing.**  It's best if this isn't explicitly labeled
   in the schedule.  Ideally, it's slop around moving from place to place, or
   longer-than-necessary breaks for food, and things like that.  This way
   people do not feel forced to "network", but are still free to socialize.

1. **Formally collect all work at the end.** You of course care *some* about
   the work being done (hopefully), so it makes sense to gather it.  There is
   also value in associating people with a project since then they feel
   accountable for it, and are more likely to continue working on it in the
   future.

1. **Contextualize.**  Make sure your participants know why the work they're
   doing is important, and what more they can do once they have good knowledge
   of the project.

I don't mean this list to be exhaustive: while not sufficient for a good
conference, these are I judge necessary conditions.  I think these events can
be very valuable, especially for bringing on new people, and don't want to
discourage them in any way, just improve them.
