I have said some things about secure boot and my involvement
[here](https://rharwood.fedorapeople.org/secureboot/2022-03-09.asc).

I will try to say the same things monthly from here on out.  The current plan
is for them to appear dated in [this
folder](https://rharwood.fedorapeople.org/secureboot/).

That said, I am human and will probably forget sometimes.  So while I
encourage keeping an eye out for them, it's probably best to reach out if I
miss one and not worry too much unless several get missed.

Please remember that this only relates to what I do and what I know: it
doesn't include other distros, other parts of the supply chain, etc..  Other
maintainers are encouraged to offer similar statements for their respective
involvement.

(This statement, this post, and especially the encouragement for other
maintainers to do the same originate from my co-worker [pjones's
statement](https://blog.uncooperative.org/uefi/secure%20boot/linux/shim/2014/06/05/shim-info.html).)
