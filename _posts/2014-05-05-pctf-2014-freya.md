In what has become something of an annual tradition, [PPP](http://pwning.net)
once again ran [Plaid CTF](http://plaidctf.com/) over CMU's Carnival break.
This year's theme was Hackers and time travel, with problems to match.  In
this post, I'm going to talk about a problem I wrote whose content relates to
things I've posted about here before.

Freya
=====

Yes, I'm going to talk about Freya.  At 250 points in the "Misc" category, it
doesn't seem too imposing.  (Assigning point values to problems is a
discussion for another time, but only five teams solved this one despite it
being open for about half of the CTF.)

Distribution
------------

The problem text (thanks, Tyler!) reads:

> We've traveled back far, but this protocol looks familiar... Our
> reconnaissance team did a great job, they got us a data capture from the
> currently running systems and a private key from the server (shell.woo.pctf

The server mentioned in the problem description is no longer running, but
distribution of the IP-DNS relationship was necessary because not only did the
problem include a pcap file, but also because I decided to use the
non-existent TLD "pctf".  Mostly this was done out of laziness.

Anyway, the problem also included two .pem files (a cert file and a private
key file) and a file called "password".  "password" just contains the
string "shellpls", and upon closer inspection, the cert file has been
provided just for convenience; it was generated from the private key file.

Intended Solution
-----------------

The first thing I did was to add an entry for shell.woo.pctf to my /etc/hosts
file, but strictly speaking this isn't necessary.  It does simplify everything
else a bit, though.

Well, there's a pcap file, so it seems reasonable to start by opening it up in
your traffic inspector of choice (I used wireshark).  So we do that and it
looks like this:

![Encrypted Traffic](http://mivehind.net/media/get-medium/8)

I've highlighted a packet from the TCP session on port 443.  Scroll through,
and there's also a TCP session on 22.  The first looks suspiciously like
HTTPS, and the second looks like SSH, which wireshark agrees with.  So we tell
wireshark to decrypt traffic using the private key.

If you've never done this before, the procedure looks something like this:

> Open wireshark. From the "Edit" menu, choose "Preferences...", then expand
> "Protocols". Scroll down and select SSL. Set an "SSL debug file:" and be
> sure that both "Reassemble SSL records spanning multiple TCP segments" and
> "Reassemble SSL Application Data spanning multiple SSL records:" are
> checked. Then next to "RSA keys list:" click the "Edit..." button. Click
> new, then enter the IP address of the server. For "Port:", enter 443, and
> for "Protocol:", enter http (not https). Select the "Key File", and leave
> the "Password:" field blank. Then click "OK", "Apply", "OK, "Apply", and
> "OK".

(The source of that procedure is my
[earlier post](http://mivehind.net/page/view-page-slug/8/ms-kkdcp-development-setup),
which contains spoilers.)

Anyway, you do that and you get this:

![Decrypted Traffic](http://mivehind.net/media/get-medium/9)

Roughly the same packet is highlighted for inspection.  There are a few
important things to notice here, including "application/kerberos", and the
POST over HTTP{,S} nature of the traffic.  The very observant will notice the
"/kkdcp" destination of the POST, but that's not strictly necessary.
Regardless, one should find Microsoft's technical document on
[MS-KKDCP](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh553774.aspx) which
outlines the protocol.

To get the key, you need to understand the protocol.  I've already written
[code](https://github.com/frozencemetery/krb5/) that does this; integration is
planned into [MIT Kerberos](https://github.com/krb5/krb5/pull/86), an effort
for which I am very grateful to my co-workers
[nalind](https://github.com/nalind),
[npmccallum](https://github.com/npmccallum/), and (my mentor)
[adamiyo](http://adam.younglogic.com/2012/05/path-to-kerberos-443/).

Even speaking the protocol, though, you're still not done.  See, the Kerberos
stuff we wrote does validation of certificates, and the Freya server uses a
garbage self-signed thing.  The easy solution (please do not do this!) is to
add the certificate to the system security store.  A better solution (which I
used) was to disable the verification in the build of Kerberos (and then not
use the build for anything else).

Once you get a TGT against the server, you also need to get a service ticket
(for "host/shell.woo.pctf").  Then you can ssh in, and the server prints the
key.  By the way, the stanzas that need to be added to /etc/krb5.conf look
like:

```ini
[realms]
  WOO.PCTF = {
	kdc = https://shell.woo.pctf/kkdcp
	default_domain = woo.pctf
  }
```

and:

```ini
[domain_realm]
  .woo.pctf = WOO.PCTF
  woo.pctf = WOO.PCTF
```

The result of this process was that I had an easy check for whether Freya was
up during the competition (thankfully, it always was).  It looked like this:

```bash
PATH=/opt/bin:$PATH time ( \
  echo "shellpls" | kinit -S host/shell.woo.pctf ppp@WOO.PCTF;
  ssh ppp@shell.woo.pctf
)
```

Other Solutions
---------------

Since we require writeups in order to collect on prizes, I have writeups from
[Dragon Sector](http://blog.dragonsector.pl/2014/04/plaidctf-2014-gcc-300-and-freya-250.html)
and
[0xffa](https://fail0verflow.com/blog/2014/plaidctf2014-misc250-freya.html)
for how they did the problem.

0xffa (congratulations for winning first place) found the protocol, and
additionally used the same git tree.  One oddity is that rather than
explicitly requesting a service ticket from the server, they pass "-K" to
`ssh` (to become `ssh -K ppp@shell.woo.pctf`); in other words, ssh will
perform the service ticket acquisition rather than kinit.  The patch they use
is also slightly different than the one I used, but the difference is minor.

Dragon Sector (congratulations for winning second place) did *not* find the
protocol, and this is really interesting to me.  Their solution involves a
proxy server that performs translation on standard traffic, but notably it's
not
[this thing I made for testing](https://github.com/frozencemetery/krb-proxies).
Instead, they used their proxy does this:

> We started proxying custom kinit requests for the key (rewriting kerberos
> protocol to HTTPS and back) in order to obtain a new kerberos key, but
> something wasn't right. It seems that the HTTPS requests and replies were
> encapsulated in some kind of container, and carried additional bytes at the
> beginning of each packet (9 and 12 bytes in those HTTP requests
> respectively). So, we simply added those bytes with our proxy (a simple
> net/file proxy written in C), taken from the original TCP/HTTPS session
> visible in wireshark. We also removed those unnecessary bytes from the KDC
> responses so kinit could interpret them.
      
More than anything, I think I'm impressed that this *works*.  The bits at the
end they remove are going to be the realm string, which indeed is not needed.
The bits at the beginning are trickier; they include ASN.1 encoding
information.  Anyway, using a local proxy means that that the krb5.conf they
use is different than the one I used.  One final oddity is that they did not
make an /etc/hosts entry; instead, they expand the ssh line, which is then

```bash
ssh ppp@54.226.73.167 \
  -o GSSAPIKeyExchange=yes -o GSSAPIServerIdentity=shell.woo.pctf
```

Server Configuration
--------------------

The shell server was running a variant of
[kdcproxy](https://github.com/npmccallum/kdcproxy) that had been tweaked to
not be WSGI.  sshd_config was also modified to disable non-GSSAPI, non-pubkey
logins.

A second server (that was not world-facing!) was configured using
[FreeIPA](http://freeipa.org/), and I used its Kerberos setup as the backend
for the shell server.

Both machines ran Fedora due to FreeIPA constraints, which complicated our
infrastructure (almost everything else was Debian).

Some Thoughts
=============

One of the things I feel is consistently missing from the CTFs we play is
interesting networks problems.  I used this problem because it was based on
material I knew extremely well, so I could confidently answer questions and
gauge where people were getting stuck.  That said, I did not think this was a
particularly difficult problem.  To be fair, I had spent the summer prodding
at the protocol, but this means that my code was already out there.

I suspect that most people got stuck at the part where traffic needs to be
decrypted.  Wireshark does not make this feature obvious, and I wish it did
because it's extremely useful for testing and reversing.  I think that many
people also approached the problem by extracting the IP of shell from the
pcap, and then were confused when shell (as per spec!) dropped malformed
requests on the floor.  This was the source of most of the "is this up?"
questions I received.

I will be making more of these.  I can't guarantee that the point value
estimation will be improved to any degree, but networks and protocol security
are not going away.  I feel these important topics in security, so: expect
them.
